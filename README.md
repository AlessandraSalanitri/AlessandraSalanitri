I'm currently in my third year of studying Computer Science at Solent University.

About Me

ðŸ’» I have knowledge in Python, Java, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and AJAX.
ðŸ“š You'll find in my repositories some of the projects I've developed during my university course.
These projects showcase my growth and dedication to mastering software development.

My Goals âœ¨
